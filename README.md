# Computational Drug Discovery Pipeline

## Goal
Perform a virtual screening experiment by docking small molecules against a disease-related protein target using AutoDock or PyRx, then analyze binding affinities to identify potential drug candidates. 
The specific target I'm interested is in Burkholderia psuedomallei.

## Plan of action
1. Identify a set of proteins in Burkholderia psuedomallei as potential therapeutic targets.
2. Find a set of small molecules that could potentially target the proteins I identified in B. pseudomallei.
3. Use Autodock or PyRx for virtual screening.
4. Generate visualizations
5. Perform additional analysis on hits identified in initial screening.
6. Compare findings with current literature.
7. Report on findings found.

## Proteins
- T3SSBsa (facilitates B. pseudomallei escape from the phagosome to replicate in the cytoplasm.)
- Autotransporter protein BimA (Enables B. pseudomallei to spread from cell to cell)
-  type 6 secretion system (T6SS-5) (Causes host membrane fusion creaing multinucleated giant cells.)
-  Type 4 pili (adherence leading to virulence)
-  Efflux Pumps (AmrAB-OprA, BpeAB-OprB, BpeEF-OprC) All these contribute to B. pseudomalleis antimicrobial resistance.
